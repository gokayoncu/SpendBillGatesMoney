# React + Vite

https://chimerical-griffin-379857.netlify.app/
The project is an expense tracking application. I designed the project using CSS, JavaScript (React.js), and Vite. I managed components and transferred data using the prop drilling method.


This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
